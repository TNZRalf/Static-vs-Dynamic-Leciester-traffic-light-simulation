# Static-vs-Dynamic-Leciester-traffic-light-simulation
This project is an Agent-Based Model (ABM) designed to simulate and optimise urban traffic flow in a high-density area of Leicester, England. By integrating real-world GIS (Geographic Information System) data, the simulation creates a realistic topology to test two distinct traffic control modes Static (Fixed-Time) vs. Dynamic (Sensor-Based).
